This is the repository for the WordCamp US themes starting with 2018. This repository contains the wp-content directory in order to work with git push on the wcus.wpengine.com multisite.

Each theme is setup as a child theme of campsite-2017 with the parent theme CSS dequeued since we'll be overriding the entire CSS with the remote CSS (child theme's style.css) anyway.

It is recommended to setup a local multisite and use Migrate DB Pro to pull down the database from wcus.wpengine.com. If you have questions contact Jason Yingling (yingling017@gmail.com).
